# Deaf Grandma

**Objective:** The objective of this assignment is to talk with Deaf Grandma.

The intent is to use either or all of the following things:

1. Conditionals
2. Looping Constructs
3. Built In String Functions

## Storyline

Whatever you say to grandma (whatever you type in), she should respond with  **HUH?!  SPEAK UP, SONNY!**, unless you shout it (type in all capitals). If you shout, she can hear you (or at least she thinks so) and yells back, **NO, NOT SINCE 1938!** To make your program really believable, have grandma shout a different year each time; maybe any year at random between **1930 and 1950**. You can't stop talking to grandma until you shout **BYE** thrice.

**Hint:** Try to think about what parts of your program should happen over and over again. All of those should be in your while loop.

1. **JavaScript Objects**
2. **Conditonals Statements**

## Assignment

You would write the code these three files
1. isUppercase.js
2. getRandomValue.js
3. index.js

`prompt-print.js` facilitates you with two important utility functions:

1. `prompt()`: Will prompt the user for the input, so when you say `prompt()`, it would wait for the input from the user and will return you the entered text/
2. `print()`: Would basically print the message on the console
